sum up all watering amounts. (send to webserver daily? (-->not lost after power cycle))

loop
{
    if wifi connection lost -> reconnect

    client connected to webserver? serve page (watering amounts, weather data, total watered amounts), act on commands (GET): water now (per plant/all), turn on lights (until midnight), vacation mode?
    
    call weather API before sunrise (~4 ?), save data for next 2 days, calculate todays watering amount. Water at sunrise. if over maximum per session, we water again in the afternoon (16?) we call weather API before and calculate again.
    
    calculate watering amount per plant: amount = min + (max-min)*(0.5*(1-cloud_percentage) + 0.5*(1-humidity_percentage))*(temp/15)*((sundown-sunrise)/12)
    
    if no weather data - water standard amount (50%?) at sunrise (6?)

    every hour - API call -> save current time and milliseconds to sync: last_time last_millis

    at sundown: turn on lights until midnight ;)
